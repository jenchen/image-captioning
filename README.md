# Image Captioning

## Project Overview
Image Captioning is the second project in Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program.  In this project, I created a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.  I used the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image.
